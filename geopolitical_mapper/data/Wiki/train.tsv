Poland–Russia relations (Polish: Stosunki polsko-rosyjskie, Russian: Российско-польские отношения) have a long but often turbulent history, dating to the late Middle Ages, when the Kingdom of Poland and Kievan Rus' and later Grand Duchy of Muscovy struggled over control of their borderlands.	0
Over centuries, there have been several Polish–Russian Wars, with Poland once occupying Moscow and later Russia controlling much of Poland in the 19th as well as in the 20th century, damaging relations.	0
According to a 2013 BBC World Service poll, 19 percent of Poles view Russia's influence positively while 49 percent express a negative view.	0
"
However, since the Russian annexation of Crimea, over 60-80% Poles are worried over the future conflict with Russia, giving the fact Russia maintains control in Kaliningrad Oblast."	0
The United States and Russia maintain diplomatic and trade relations.	1
In 2014, relations greatly deteriorated further due to the crisis in Ukraine, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, differences regarding Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and from the end of 2016 over Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.	0

Iran has also deployed submarines and warships off Yemen’s coast, in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea, ostensibly to conduct anti-piracy operations.	0
Diplomatic relations are cordial, although the Solomon Islands government has aligned itself with other countries in the region to urge Fiji interim Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama to restore democracy in Fiji.	1
"In August 2008, it was announced that Solomon Islands intended to open a High Commission in Suva, and in December the government of Fiji announced that it had ""formally endorsed the establishment of a Resident Diplomatic Mission in Suva by the Government of Solomon Islands""."	1
Fiji's High Commission to Papua New Guinea is accredited to Solomon Islands.	1

There are no diplomatic relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, largely due to the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.	0
The neighboring nations had formal governmental relations between 1918 and 1921, during their brief independence from the collapsed Russian Empire, as the First Republic of Armenia and the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan; these relations existed from the period after the Russian Revolution until they were occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union.	1
Due to the two wars waged by the countries in the past century—one from 1918 to 1921 and another from 1988 to 1994—the two have had strained relations.	0
Since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, relations between the two countries have been strained over various geopolitical issues such as the interpretations of Islam, aspirations for leadership of the Islamic world, and relations with the United States, Europe and other Western countries.	0

"
From 1961 until 1973, Burkina Faso recognized the Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative in China."	1
"
From September 15, 1973 to February 4, 1994, Ouagadougou and its five successive presidents maintained a modest relationship with Beijing (in terms of projects and financing)."	1
Opportunistic, this recognition came two years after the accession of so-called mainland China to the UN Security Council.	0
"In 1971, Burkina Faso (then still ""Upper Volta"") opposed with the United States to the Resolution 2758 of the United Nations General Assembly of October 25, 1971."	1
Maurice Yaméogo (president from 1959 to 1966) had however, maintained relations with Beijing before the formalization of bilateral relations, that is to say during the Taiwanese-Burkinabe cooperation.	1
But Burkina Faso is the only African state to have twice recognized the Republic of China: in 1964 and in 1994.	1
In any case, China does not seem willing to offer it, although Compaore was the first African leader to visit China after Tiananmen.	0
"The envisaged impacts of the currency depreciation and the general economic situation of the country incite the Burkinabè head of State to choose the only partner able to finance quickly and unconditionally - except his recognition - his future ""national commitments"": Taiwan."	0
"
As a result, Taiwan helped finance the political program of the former Burkinabe leader who received between 40 and 50 million dollars from Taiwan to recognize the Republic of China to the detriment of the People's Republic of China."	0
On 24 May 2018, Burkina Faso again cut ties with the Republic of China and two days later, on 26 May, Burkina Faso re-established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.	1

Japan responded with attacks on the Allies, including the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which heavily damaged the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, opening the Pacific theater of World War II.	0
The United States made a massive investment in naval power and systematically destroyed Japan's offensive capabilities while island hopping across the Pacific.	0
To force a surrender, the Americans systematically bombed Japanese cities, culminating in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.	0
Japan surrendered, and was subjected to seven years of military occupation by the United States, during which the American occupiers under General Douglas MacArthur eliminated the military factor and rebuilt the economic and political systems so as to transform Japan into a democracy.	0
 The trade relationship has particularly prospered since then, with Japanese automobiles and consumer electronics being especially popular, and Japan became the world's second economic power after the United States. (	1

The Uganda–Tanzania War, known in Tanzania as the Kagera War (Kiswahili: Vita vya Kagera) and in Uganda as the 1979 Liberation War, was fought between Uganda and Tanzania from October 1978 until June 1979, and led to the overthrow of Ugandan President Idi Amin.	0
The war was preceded by a deterioration of relations between Uganda and Tanzania following Amin's overthrow of President Milton Obote and subsequent seizure of power in 1971.	0
The President of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, had close ties with Obote and supported an attempt by him to launch a rebellion in Uganda in 1972, leading to a border clash and eventually the signing of an agreement with Amin which stipulated that both leaders would withdraw their forces from the Uganda–Tanzania border.	0
Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense, and Amin began claiming that the Kagera Salient—a stretch of Tanzanian land between the official border and the Kagera River, should be placed under Uganda's jurisdiction.	0
Over the following years Amin's regime was destabilised by violent purges, economic problems, and dissatisfaction in the Uganda Army.	0
In October 1978 Ugandan forces began making incursions into Tanzania.	0
Later that month the Uganda Army launched an invasion, looting property and killing civilians.	0
Ugandan official media declared the annexation of the Kagera Salient.	0
On 2 November Nyerere declared war on Uganda and mobilised the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) to retake the salient.	0
The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) failed to mediate a diplomatic resolution, and the TPDF launched a counteroffensive, re-securing Kagera by January 1979 and occupying the Ugandan border town of Mutukula.	0
Nyerere also mobilised Ugandan rebels loyal to Obote and Yoweri Museveni to weaken Amin's regime.	0
After Amin failed to renounce his claims to Kagera and the OAU failed to condemn the Ugandan invasion, he decided that Tanzanian forces should occupy the towns of Masaka and Mbarara in southern Uganda in the hopes that this would trigger a popular uprising against Amin and lead to his overthrow.	0
The TPDF's 20th Division launched its offensive in February and occupied the towns, but no uprising occurred.	0
"
While the TPDF's 20th Division prepared to clear the way to Kampala, the Ugandan capital, Muammar Gaddafi, the leader of Libya and an ally of Amin, dispatched several thousand troops to Uganda to assist the Uganda Army."	0
The Palestinian Liberation Organisation also sent a number of guerrillas to aid Amin.	0
In March the largest battle of the war occurred when the Tanzanians and Ugandan rebels defeated a combined Ugandan-Libyan-Palestinian force at Lukaya.	0
The loss of Lukaya led the Uganda Army to begin to completely collapse.	0
Though Nyerere believed that after the Libyan intervention at Lukaya it was no longer possible to count on the Ugandan rebels being able to capture Kampala by themselves, he felt that it was highly important they should be given time to organise their own government to succeed Amin.	0
He sponsored a conference of Ugandan rebels and exiles in Moshi later that month, which led to unifying of the rebel groups as the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF).	0
Immediately following the conference Gaddafi formally threatened to militarily intervene in the conflict on Amin's behalf, but Nyerere decided to continue with the war.	0
In early April the TPDF seized the airport in Entebbe, inflicting heavy casualties on Libyan troops and destroying the Uganda Army Air Force.	0
Libya ended its intervention and its troops fled the country.	0
On 10 April a combined TPDF-UNLF force attacked Kampala, and secured it the following day.	0
Amin fled into exile while a UNLF government was established.	0
In the following months the TPDF occupied Uganda, facing only scattered resistance from the remnants of the Uganda Army, whose personnel looted and killed civilians while fleeing the country, retreating particularly to Zaire and Sudan.	0
The TPDF secured the Uganda–Sudan border in June, bringing the war to an end.	0
"
The overthrow of a sovereign head of state by a foreign military had never occurred in post-colonial Africa, and Nyerere's decision to invade Uganda provoked a row in the OAU."	0
The war severely harmed Tanzania's fragile economy and inflicted long-lasting damage to Kagera.	0
The Uganda–Tanzania border dispute remained at low intensity until its resolution in 2001.	0
The war also had severe economic consequences in Uganda, and brought about a wave of crime and political violence as the UNLF government struggled to maintain order.	0
Political disagreements and the persistence of the remnants of the Uganda Army in the border regions ultimately led to the outbreak of the Ugandan Bush War in 1980.	0
French–Vietnamese relations started as early as the 17th century with the mission of the Jesuit father Alexandre de Rhodes.	1

Relations deteriorated again in the 1950s due to the Cyprus issue, the 1955 Istanbul pogrom and the expulsion of the Istanbul Greeks in the 1960s, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, and subsequent military confrontations over the Aegean dispute.	0
"A period of relative normalization began after 1999 with the so-called ""earthquake diplomacy"", which notably led to a change in the previously firmly negative stance of the Greek government on the issue of the accession of Turkey to the European Union."	1
Afghanistan–China relations or Sino–Afghan relations have been mostly friendly throughout history, with trade relations between these regions date back to at least the Han dynasty with the profitable Silk Road.	1
Since the establishment of the modern nation of Afghanistan (1709), relations have been mostly warm and friendly, including during most of the 20th century, with the two countries fighting together against Japan in WW2, and with China extending economic aid and multi-million dollar loans to develop Afghanistan during the early Cold war period.	1
This friendship was briefly interrupted after the Sino-Soviet split and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979), with Russia installing pro-Soviet and anti-Chinese regimes in Afghanistan.	0
However, since the withdrawal of Soviet troops and détente of Russian-Chinese relations, Sino-Afghan relations have also improved significantly in the 21st century.	1
Since the United States invasion initiating the War in Afghanistan (2001–present), Chinese political involvement initially has been somewhat limited, but trade relations have still been continuing with China as Afghanistan's largest trading partner and China giving Afghanistan millions of dollars in aid throughout the war.	1
China's influence and shuttle diplomatic role in Afghanistan has also been growing over the years, and China could help broker peace in the war-torn country.	1

From the 10th century onward, the Piast Kingdom of Poland established under Duke Mieszko I had close and chequered relations with the Holy Roman Empire.	1
 However, these relations were overshadowed by the centuries-long Polish–Teutonic Wars, as a result of which the Teutonic Duchy of Prussia became a fief of the Kingdom of Poland.	0
After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles deprived Germany of its territories in West Prussia, East Upper Silesia and Danzig (Gdansk) and transferred them all to Poland.	0
